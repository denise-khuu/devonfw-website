=== devonfw introduction

devonfw, the devonfw platform. This is a product of the CSD industrialization effort to bring a standardized platform for custom software development within Capgemini APPS2. This platform is aimed at engagements where clients do not force the use of a determined technology so we can offer a better alternative coming from our experience as a group.
devonfw is a development platform aiming for standardization of processes and productivity boost, that provides an architecture blueprint for Java/JavaScript applications, alongside a set of tools to provide a fully functional out-of-the-box development environment.

== devonfw guide

First things first. If you're a developer just starting with devonfw, you should have a look at the devonfw guide. It serves as an entry point and reference document for everything related to devonfw.

You can use the devonfw Console, devcon, to help you with many automated tasks around the full life-cycle of devonfw applications, from installing the basic working environment and generating a new project, to running a test server and deploying an application to production, devcon is the easiest way to use devonfw.

If you're an experienced hand, like a senior developer or architect, you should add the devon4J guide.

devonfw uses devon4J as lean open source architecture blueprint for the server side of an application. devon4J offers you a comprehensive documentation for building your application. Stop with digging in the docs of many different open source projects in parallel, getting on the wrong track or lost in space.
